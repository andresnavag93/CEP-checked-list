## CEPTINEL Events List

- List the elements
- Paginate the list (10 elements per page)
- Allow to filter the table according to the content of its fields
- Leave it running on github pages
- The content must be responsive
- Add a counter that allows me to know how many elements are seen and how many are not seen
- Allow marking a list item as "seen"
- Filter the list by date / time range (edited)
